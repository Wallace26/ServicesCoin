This is the reference code for [ServicesCoin](https://cryptonote.org) cryptocurrency protocol.

Our coin is forked off the cryptonight algorithm, straight from the CryptoNoteFoundation. 

Standard GNU applies. 

No Donation addresses are noted, as no donations are needed, thank you. 
This will work purely on hard work and determination:)

This is that small inexperienced chain of events that evolve into being something truly awesome. 

ServicesCoin stems from the utter need for seamless, Small Business transactions. This is wholly thanks to the huge amounts of 1 man, owner operated businesses out there.

We are well on our way to releasing not only the superfast, secure ServicesCoin, based on the CryptoNight Algorithm, but a multi level security mobile and desktop applications. 

This will reduce, or perhaps eliminate the need to accept cash payments, or carrying it. With this, the Small Business flourishes, and hopefully reduce the accounts of robberies etc, locally here in South Africa. 

This project will be totally and completely focused on the Mzansi landscape, and all of our Micro and small businesses. 

The original name was supposed to have been named HayleysComet(Coin),named after my daughter, but was just not working in most configurations etc etc. But nonetheless, this is dedicated to her, as a reminder to her that she will be awesome, in everything she does, ALWAYS! :)

PS: Whitepaper and official site will be up soon as well. The only difference here is:
No standard ICO, as in the sense of 0% pre-sale of any coin, for infrastructure here, or there. No "fund-raising" WHATSOEVER!
This coin is is an ode to the "small" people. And is going exactly there:)

--EDIT: Site/mining pool is up now @ cryptomaniax.co.za.
